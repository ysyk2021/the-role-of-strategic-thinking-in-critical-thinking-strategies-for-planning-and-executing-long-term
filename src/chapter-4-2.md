A growth mindset is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through hard work, dedication, and perseverance. This is in contrast to a fixed mindset, which is the belief that abilities and intelligence are innate and cannot be changed.

By embracing a growth mindset, individuals can approach challenges with a sense of curiosity and a willingness to learn and grow. This can support strategic thinking by encouraging individuals to take risks, learn from failures, and adapt to changing circumstances.
