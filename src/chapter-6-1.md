Identifying potential obstacles and challenges involves anticipating potential roadblocks and developing contingency plans for addressing them. This can involve conducting a SWOT analysis or other type of environmental scan to identify internal and external factors that may impact the achievement of the goal.

Evaluate Options and Alternatives
